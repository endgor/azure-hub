This repository contains a Next.js application for Azure IP lookups. When making changes:

- Use **npm** for running scripts and managing dependencies.
- Before committing, run `npm run lint` to check code style.
- If tests exist, run `npm test` and ensure they pass.
- Keep changes focused: avoid adding files or dependencies that are not required.
- Follow the existing TypeScript and ESLint configurations.
